#Presentation
Hello my name is Alex but the people call me Driger, I'm trying to make a full cross-device Linux distro... but I have problems
programming because I don't know some languages, I'll be grateful for your help. Thanks to be patient.

#Launch
The DolphinOS launch, if some people (4 or 6) help with the project... DolphinOS can be launched in spring 2016 but if I do myself maybe
in winter 2016

#Interfaces
DolphinOS will be have some interfaces for any device, because that is the big point of the OS:
- Desktop and All in One (Linux)
- Windows Theme
- OS X Theme
- 2 in 1 (Tablet/Laptop)
- Only Tablet
- Digital and Touchable Whiteboards (For Workspaces or Schools)
- Tablets of Drawing
- Android (An .apk for install the UI and some accesories)
- Windows 10 for Phones (Maybe in the future with a license)
- Wearbles (Maybe this will be very hard but I have the Concept)
- TV's
- Car devices (This will be hard too)
- VirtualReality devices.
- more...
